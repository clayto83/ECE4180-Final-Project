Bluetooth Media Player

Welcome to the ECE4180-Final-Project wiki!

Nirmal Karthik and Clayton Walker (Section B)

Our Project: The purpose of our project is to create a Bluetooth media player with the following functionality:
 - Plays Wav Files from an SD card
 - Includes a Display to show the name of the file playing
 - Outputs the audio via a speaker and an audio jack
 - The user can use Bluetooth to select initial song, pause/play, or adjust the volume via the Bluefruit GUI

It accomplishes this using the Mbed with RTOS threads for the Bluetooth, the LCD, and the audio output. We also needed to make some modifications to the wave_player library to enable the pause/play, and volume adjustment features. For more details on this project, please visit our wiki page:
